# Dungeon-Crawler

## Introduction
This is a Dungeon Crawler game developed in Fall of 2023 for CS 2340 at Georgia Tech. It was developed in Android Studio with Java and XML and was created for Android devices. Several developmental diagrams are included for your perusal.

## Game Overview
Like the classic Dungeon Crawlers of the 1980s, this dungeon crawler game is a simple, 2D game. Select your character, navigate with a D-Pad around the rooms, and defeat enemies to get points and climb the leaderboard! The game has three rooms to navigate through and several powerups to try to activate!
